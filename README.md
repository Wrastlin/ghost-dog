## SLA Benchmarks (Quick Reference)

| Metric | Industry Floor | Best-in-Class | ReliableClaim Target |
|--------|---------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Emergency on-site | 24 hours | 2 hours | **4 hours** |
| First contact (standard) | 48 hours | 4 hours | **4 hours** |

## Three Differentiators

1. **Publish SLAs publicly** -- No TPA does this. Transparency builds trust with carriers and contractors alike.
2. **Pay contractors in 15 days** -- Industry standard is 30-90+ days. Fast payment attracts better contractors.
3. **Structured communication SLAs** -- 48-hour updates, 2-hour callbacks. The #1 unmet need in the industry.
