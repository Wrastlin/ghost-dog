## Key Findings Summary (Quick Reference)

### Industry-Standard SLA Benchmarks
| Metric | Floor | Ceiling (Best) | Most Common |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| Emergency contact | 2 hours | 15 minutes | 1 hour |
| Emergency on-site | 24 hours | 2 hours | 4 hours |
| Non-emergency first contact | 48 hours | 4 hours | 24 hours |
| Non-emergency inspection | 72 hours | 24 hours | 48 hours |
| Estimate upload | 7+ days | 24 hours | 5 days |
| Workmanship warranty | 1 year | 5 years | 3-5 years |
| Customer reuse rate | 85% | 99.1% | 95%+ |
| Contractor removal threshold | Varies | Varies | "Satisfactory rating" |

### Top-Ranked TPAs (RIA 2025 Scorecard)
1. **OnCORE Repair** - #1 for 3 consecutive years
2. **Hancock Claims PRN** - Highest marks in credentialing (4.0)
3. **Contractor Connection** - Largest network, most public SLA data

### Critical Pain Points (Contractor Perspective)
- TPA fees: 5-20% of gross claim revenue
- Payment delays: 30-90 days standard, 60-180 days disputed
- Scope shortfall: Initial estimates cover only 50-65% of actual cost
- Admin burden: Requires dedicated FTE for portal management
- 45% of contractors would prefer no TPA work at all
