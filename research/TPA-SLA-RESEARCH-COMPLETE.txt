1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
========================================

TPAs Researched: 15+
Source Documents Found: 80+
Native PDFs Cataloged: 22+
SLA Tiers Proposed: 6

THREE BIG DIFFERENTIATORS FOR RELIABLECLAIM:

1. PUBLISH YOUR SLAs
   No TPA does this publicly. Contractor Connection publishes a few
   metrics; everyone else hides behind portals. Publishing SLAs
   signals confidence and builds trust with carriers and contractors.

2. PAY CONTRACTORS FAST
   Net 15 days vs. industry norm of 60-180 days. This alone would
   make ReliableClaim the clear choice for quality contractors who
   currently avoid TPA work. Better contractors = better outcomes.

3. OWN THE COMMUNICATION GAP
   48-hour update cadence, 2-hour callbacks, milestone notifications.
   This is the #1 unmet need cited by both policyholders and adjusters.

MARKET OPPORTUNITY:
- Alacrity selling its MRP division (Jan 2026) creates a gap
- 45% of contractors would prefer no TPA work at all
- Whoever treats contractors best wins the talent

========================================
6. CONTRACTOR PAIN POINTS
========================================

45% OF CONTRACTORS WOULD PREFER NO TPA WORK AT ALL.

PAYMENT DELAYS
  30-90 days standard. Disputed claims add another 30-90 days.
  Contractors front all labor and material costs.
  TPA referral fees: 5-20% off the top.

SCOPE SHORTFALL
  Initial estimates cover only 50-65% of actual repair cost.
  35-50% supplement gap is the norm.
  Experienced contractors add 25-30% through supplements.

ADMIN BURDEN
  Most successful contractors dedicate at least 1 FTE to TPA portals.
  Multiple proprietary software portals to manage.
  Xactimate, ProfileGorilla, drying logs, OSHA, moisture reports.
  "It's the office, computer, documentation work that is so time consuming."

UNREALISTIC RESPONSE TIMES
  "Feel compressed" and "interfere with ability to execute the work."
  Need to "hire administrative help to remain compliant."

SLA ENFORCEMENT
  Reduced assignments for underperformers.
  30-day disciplinary action for untimely repairs.
  Network removal for persistent non-compliance.
  "Minor errors can result in sudden reduction in work."

OVERHEAD GAP
  Actual contractor overhead: ~30%
  What insurers allow: ~10%
  Industry recommendation: Keep TPA work <= 20% of total revenue.

FINANCIAL REALITY:
  TPA referral fees: 5-20% of gross
  Xactimate subscription: Required
  ProfileGorilla/compliance: Additional subscription
  Dedicated admin FTE: ~1 person
  Total overhead for TPA work: Can approach 13%+ of revenue
