**Prepared for**: ReliableClaim.com
**Date**: February 7, 2026
**Scope**: Competitive SLA analysis of 15+ TPAs and national restoration networks

## The Landscape

The insurance restoration TPA market is dominated by a handful of players managing billions in claim volume:

| TPA | Scale | Owner | Key Metric |
|-----|-------|-------|-----------|
| **Contractor Connection** | 6,000+ contractors, $3B/yr, 500K assignments | Crawford & Company | 99.1% customer reuse rate |
| **Sedgwick Repair** | 2,000+ locations | Sedgwick | Iron Clad Warranty (survives contractor failure) |
| **Alacrity Solutions** | National network | Selling MRP division (Jan 2026) | AlacNet platform |
| **Hancock Claims PRN** | National | Independent | #1 RIA credentialing score (4.0) |
| **Accuserve** | National | Independent | 1-day onboarding, no fees to join |
| **OnCORE Repair** | -- | -- | #1 RIA TPA Scorecard, 3 consecutive years |
| **CoreLogic/Cotality** | 8,700+ companies on platform | Cotality | VPASS (Six Sigma scoring) |

**Market dynamics**: Alacrity selling its MRP division creates opportunity. 45% of contractors would prefer no TPA work. Carrier pressure on cycle times and costs is intensifying.

## What the Best TPAs Require (SLA Benchmarks)

| Category | Industry Floor | Best-in-Class | Competitive Target |
|----------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Emergency on-site | 24 hours | 2 hours (DKI) | **4 hours** |
| First contact (standard) | 48 hours | 4 hours | **4 hours** |
| Estimate upload | 7+ days | 24 hours | **48 hours** |
| Workmanship warranty | 1 year | 5 years | **5 years** |
| Customer satisfaction | 85% | 97% | **95%+** |
| Payment to contractors | 30-90 days | -- | **Net 15** |

## Where the Industry Falls Short (Opportunity)

**Based on contractor forums, RIA data, and BBB complaints:**

1. **Payment speed**: 30-90 day cycles are standard; disputed claims add 30-90 more. Contractors front all costs. **Net 15 payment would be revolutionary.**

2. **Scope accuracy**: Initial TPA estimates cover only 50-65% of actual cost. 35-50% supplement gap is the norm. **Accurate first-scope = fewer supplements = faster cycle times.**

3. **Transparency**: No TPA publishes their SLAs publicly. Scoring systems are opaque. **A public SLA dashboard builds trust with both carriers and contractors.**

4. **Admin burden**: Contractors need a dedicated FTE just for TPA portal management. **Streamlined single-portal experience differentiates.**

5. **Fee transparency**: TPA fees range 5-20% with hidden charges. **Published fee schedule = contractor loyalty.**

6. **Communication cadence**: Few TPAs enforce specific update frequencies. Adjusters and homeowners both cite communication as #1 pain point. **Structured communication SLAs fill this gap.**

## Recommended ReliableClaim SLA Framework (6 Tiers)

| Tier | Category | Headline SLA |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **1** | Response Time | 15-min acceptance, 4-hr emergency on-site, 4-hr standard first contact |
| **2** | Quality | 5-year warranty, 95%+ CSAT, <3% callback rate, 100% IICRC compliance |
| **3** | Communication | 48-hr update cadence, 2-hr callback, 72-hr supplement submission |
| **4** | Operations | 48-hr estimate upload, same-day photos, 24-hr moisture readings |
| **5** | Credentialing | WRT/AMRT/FSRT required, $1M GL, background checks, annual renewal |
| **6** | Payment | Net 15 to contractors, 48-hr invoicing, <2% revision rate |

**Full framework**: See `recommended-sla-framework.md`

## Three Big Differentiators for ReliableClaim

### 1. Publish Your SLAs
No TPA does this. Contractor Connection publishes a few metrics; everyone else hides behind portals. Publishing SLAs publicly signals confidence and builds trust with both sides of the claim.

### 2. Pay Contractors Fast
Net 15 payment terms would make ReliableClaim the clear choice for quality contractors who currently avoid TPA work because of 60-180 day payment cycles. Better contractors = better outcomes = carrier satisfaction.

### 3. Own the Communication Gap
Build structured communication SLAs (48-hour updates, 2-hour callbacks, milestone notifications) into every program. This is the #1 unmet need in the industry according to both policyholders and adjusters.
