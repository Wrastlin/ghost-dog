## Tier 1: Response Time SLAs

### 1.1 Emergency Response

| SLA | Industry Floor | Industry Ceiling | **ReliableClaim Target** |
|-----|---------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Assignment acceptance | 1 hour | 15 min (CC) | **15 minutes** |
| Customer contact (phone) | 2 hours | 15 min (CC 3-way) | **30 minutes** |
| On-site arrival | 24 hours | 2 hours (DKI) | **4 hours** (2 hours in primary markets) |
| Emergency mitigation started | Same day | Immediate on arrival | **Within 1 hour of arrival** |

**Rationale**: Match Contractor Connection on acceptance speed. Beat the field on actual customer contact. 4-hour on-site is achievable and competitive; 2-hour in home markets shows you're serious.

### 1.2 Non-Emergency / Standard Claims

| SLA | Industry Floor | Industry Ceiling | **ReliableClaim Target** |
|-----|---------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| First contact with policyholder | 48 hours | 4 hours | **4 hours (business hours) / 12 hours (after hours)** |
| On-site inspection | 72 hours | 24 hours | **24 hours** |
| Preliminary scope communicated | 7 days | 24 hours | **48 hours** |

**Rationale**: Speed on first contact is the #1 CSAT driver. Nobody consistently hits 4 hours -- owning this SLA is a major differentiator.

### 1.3 Estimate & Documentation

| SLA | Industry Floor | Industry Ceiling | **ReliableClaim Target** |
|-----|---------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Preliminary estimate upload | 7+ days | 24 hours | **48 hours** |
| Final estimate to adjuster | 10+ days | 24 hours post-completion | **24 hours post-completion** |
| Photo documentation uploaded | Varies | Same day | **Same day as inspection** |
| Moisture readings uploaded | Daily | Real-time (Mitigate) | **Every 24 hours minimum** |
| Supplement submission | 30+ days | 72 hours | **72 hours after scope change identified** |

**Rationale**: Estimate speed is where most contractors fall down. 48 hours for preliminary is aggressive but achievable and puts you ahead of 90% of the field. Same-day photos is easy with modern tools.

## Tier 2: Quality SLAs

### 2.1 Workmanship & Inspection

| SLA | Industry Floor | Industry Ceiling | **ReliableClaim Target** |
|-----|---------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Workmanship warranty | 1 year | 5 years | **5 years** |
| Inspection pass rate (first time) | -- | -- | **95%** |
| Callback / redo rate | -- | -- | **<3%** |
| IICRC compliance rate | -- | 100% | **100% (all jobs follow applicable IICRC standard)** |

**Rationale**: 5-year warranty matches top TPAs. Publicly committing to an inspection pass rate is something nobody does -- it's a trust signal. <3% callback sets you apart.

### 2.2 Customer Satisfaction

| SLA | Industry Floor | Industry Ceiling | **ReliableClaim Target** |
|-----|---------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Customer satisfaction (CSAT) | 85% | 97% (CC) | **95%+** |
| Would-recommend / reuse rate | -- | 99.1% (CC) | **97%+** |
| NPS score | 35-36 (insurance avg) | -- | **70+** |
| Post-job survey completion rate | -- | -- | **80%+** |

**Rationale**: 95% CSAT is achievable and competitive. NPS of 70+ puts you in "excellent" territory for any industry. The survey completion rate SLA ensures you're actually measuring.

## Tier 3: Communication SLAs

### 3.1 Policyholder Communication

| SLA | **ReliableClaim Target** | Notes |
|-----|------------------------|-------|
| Initial contact after assignment | 30 min (emergency) / 4 hours (standard) | Phone call, not just text/email |
| Status update frequency (active job) | Every 48 hours minimum | More frequent during active mitigation |
| Returned calls/messages | Within 2 hours during business hours | Same business day if after hours |
| Job completion notification | Within 1 hour of completion | Includes satisfaction survey link |
| Final walkthrough scheduling | Within 24 hours of work completion | Before billing |

### 3.2 Adjuster/Carrier Communication

| SLA | **ReliableClaim Target** | Notes |
|-----|------------------------|-------|
| Initial scope/assessment report | Within 24 hours of inspection | With photos |
| Status updates | Every 48 hours or at each milestone | Whichever is sooner |
| Scope change notification | Within 4 hours of discovery | Before additional work begins |
| Supplement submission | Within 72 hours of scope change | With full documentation |
| Completion certificate | Within 24 hours of job completion | With final photos and readings |
| Invoice submission | Within 48 hours of completion certificate | Clean, accurate, no surprises |

**Rationale**: Communication is the #1 complaint about contractors from both policyholders and adjusters. Specific, measurable cadences make this enforceable and differentiating.
