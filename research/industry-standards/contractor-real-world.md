## Contractor Pain Points

### 1. Unrealistic Response Times
- 1-hour emergency response window (three-way call)
- 24-hour homeowner contact for non-emergency
- 24-hour estimate upload deadlines
- "Feel compressed" and "interfere with ability to actually execute the work"
- Need to "hire administrative help to remain compliant, which increases overhead cost"

### 2. Documentation Burden
- Xactimate/Symbility-formatted estimates mandatory
- Profile Gorilla or similar compliance subscription
- Real-time logging of all calls, inspections, uploads, completion schedules
- Background checks on every job-site employee
- Licensing and certification renewals
- OSHA respirator fit tests
- IICRC-compliant documentation (moisture logs, drying records, photos)
- "It's the office, computer, documentation work that is so time consuming"

### 3. Payment Delays
- **30-90 day** payment cycles standard
- Disputed claims add another **30-90 days**
- Homeowners sometimes receive checks directly, leaving contractors chasing payment
- Insurers intentionally stall payments to manage cash flow
- Contractors must **front all labor and material costs**
- TPA referral fees (5-20%) come off the top

### 4. Scope Limitations
- Average insurance scope written for **50-65% of actual repair cost**
- Insurers (not qualified contractors) determine scope of work
- TPAs mandate contractors work within pre-approved scope

### 5. Supplement Challenges
- 35-50% gap between initial scope and actual cost requires supplementing
- Experienced contractors report adding 25-30% through supplements
- "Sometimes insurance refuses to pay for full value of work performed"
- Adjusters "routinely miss lots of items, whether intentional or due to inexperience"

### 6. SLA Enforcement Consequences
- **Reduced assignments** for underperformers
- **30-day disciplinary action** for untimely repairs
- **Network removal** for persistent non-compliance
- Scored against peer contractors in the same market
- "Little room for error" on internal scorecards
- "Minor errors in job site work, button pushing, estimate uploading, or invoicing can result in sudden and substantial reduction in work"

### 7. Communication Overhead
- Regular adjuster updates (ongoing)
- Three-way calls with homeowners and TPA
- Multiple proprietary software portals to manage
- "Program work creates an administrative burden -- estimators, PMs, and technicians are all given additional duties"
- Most successful contractors dedicate **at least one FTE solely to TPA portal management**
