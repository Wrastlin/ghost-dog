## 1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE

### 1.1 Purpose

This Contractor Service Level Agreement ("Agreement" or "SLA") establishes the mutual obligations, performance standards, and operational expectations between Reliable Claim Solutions ("Reliable Claim," "Company," or "we") and the independent contractor or contracting firm ("Contractor," "you," or "Service Provider") engaged to perform mitigation and reconnaissance services on insurance property claims administered by Reliable Claim.

Reliable Claim exists to serve two parties who have historically been pitted against each other: the insurance carrier seeking fair and accurate claim resolution, and the skilled contractor seeking steady, fairly compensated work. This Agreement reflects that dual commitment. Every standard contained herein was designed not only to protect policyholders and carriers, but to ensure that Contractors who meet these standards are rewarded with consistent assignments, timely payment, and a genuine partnership -- not a one-sided mandate.

### 1.2 Scope of Services

This Agreement governs all mitigation and reconnaissance assignments dispatched through Reliable Claim, including but not limited to:

**Mitigation Services:**
- Water extraction and structural drying (IICRC S500 Category 1, 2, and 3 losses)
- Mold assessment and remediation support (IICRC S520 protocol)
- Emergency board-up, tarping, and temporary stabilization
- Smoke and soot removal (IICRC S700 protocol)
- Contents protection, pack-out, and inventory
- Debris removal incidental to covered losses
- Emergency HVAC shutdown and isolation
- Biohazard containment and decontamination (IICRC S540 protocol, where credentialed)

**Reconnaissance Services:**
- Initial loss site inspection and assessment
- Photographic and video documentation of loss conditions
- Moisture mapping and readings
- Scope-of-loss evaluation and preliminary damage assessment
- Cause-of-loss observation and reporting
- Environmental testing coordination (when directed by carrier)
- Re-inspection and progress verification
- Completion verification and final walkthrough

### 1.3 Relationship of the Parties

Contractor is and shall remain an independent contractor. Nothing in this Agreement creates an employer-employee, partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship. Contractor maintains full control over the means and methods of performing the work, subject to the outcome-based standards set forth herein. Contractor is solely responsible for all employment taxes, benefits, and obligations for its own employees and subcontractors.

### 1.4 Geographic Applicability

This Agreement applies within the geographic service areas mutually agreed upon during onboarding and documented in Exhibit A (Service Territory). Reliable Claim is committed to deliberate, sustainable growth. We do not chase statewide coverage at the expense of service quality. Contractors are assigned work within their confirmed service territory, and expansion into new territories occurs only by mutual written agreement when both parties are operationally prepared.

---

## 2. DEFINITIONS

For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms carry the meanings set forth below:

**"Active Job"** -- Any assignment that has been accepted by Contractor and has not yet received a Completion Certificate.

**"Assignment"** -- A specific job dispatched to Contractor through the Reliable Claim platform, constituting an offer of work under the terms of this Agreement.

**"Business Day"** -- Monday through Friday, 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM local time at the loss site, excluding federal holidays.

**"Business Hours"** -- The hours constituting a Business Day as defined above.

**"Carrier"** -- The insurance company, self-insured entity, or managing general agent on whose behalf Reliable Claim administers the claim.

**"Catastrophe Event" (CAT Event)** -- A natural or man-made event resulting in a declared state of emergency or a surge in claim volume exceeding 200% of normal weekly assignment volume within a defined geographic area, as determined by Reliable Claim.

**"Completion Certificate"** -- A formal notice issued by Contractor through the Reliable Claim platform confirming that all contracted work has been finished and documented.

**"Emergency Assignment"** -- Any assignment involving active water intrusion, fire damage, biohazard exposure, or structural instability that poses an immediate threat to persons or property.

**"Loss Site"** -- The physical location of the insured property where services are to be performed.

**"Moisture Reading"** -- A quantitative measurement of moisture content in building materials taken with a calibrated moisture meter (pin or pinless) and expressed in percentage or relative scale, documented with location, material type, and timestamp.

**"Policyholder"** -- The named insured or their authorized representative on the insurance policy under which the claim is filed.

**"Preliminary Scope"** -- The initial assessment of damage extent and anticipated work, communicated before a formal Xactimate estimate is prepared.

**"Reconnaissance" (Recon)** -- The process of inspecting, documenting, and assessing a loss site to determine the nature, cause, and extent of damage without performing physical restoration work.

**"Reliable Claim Platform"** -- The web-based portal, mobile application, and associated communication systems operated by Reliable Claim for assignment dispatch, documentation upload, status tracking, and invoicing.

**"Scorecard"** -- A monthly performance report issued to Contractor reflecting measured performance against the SLAs in this Agreement.

**"Standard Assignment"** -- Any assignment that is not classified as an Emergency Assignment.

**"Supplement"** -- A formal request for additional scope and/or compensation beyond the original approved estimate, submitted with supporting documentation.

**"Xactimate"** -- The Xactanalysis/Xactimate estimating software platform published by Verisk, used as the standard for line-item estimating in insurance restoration.

---

## 3. GUIDING PRINCIPLES

Reliable Claim was founded on a conviction that the insurance restoration industry can work better for everyone involved -- carriers, policyholders, and contractors alike. The following principles are not aspirational platitudes; they are the operational philosophy embedded in every section of this Agreement.

### 3.1 Fair Compensation for Honest Work

We believe that a contractor who responds quickly, documents thoroughly, communicates proactively, and performs quality work deserves to be paid fairly and promptly. This Agreement does not squeeze contractor margins to manufacture savings for carriers. Instead, we eliminate overcharges and waste through accurate scoping, transparent processes, and mutual accountability -- so that every dollar spent reflects work actually needed and actually performed.

### 3.2 Steady Work over Rapid Expansion

We do not pursue growth for its own sake. A contractor who joins our network should receive a predictable, manageable volume of quality assignments -- not a flood that overwhelms their capacity, and not a trickle that doesn't justify the relationship. We scale deliberately, adding territories and contractors only when we can sustain the service levels in this Agreement.

### 3.3 Mutual Accountability

Every obligation in this Agreement runs in two directions. When we require Contractor to accept an assignment within fifteen minutes, we commit to dispatching that assignment with complete and accurate information. When we require documentation within twenty-four hours, we commit to reviewing it within a defined window. When we expect quality workmanship, we commit to paying for it on time. The SLAs herein bind both parties.

### 3.4 Transparency by Default

Our fee structures are published. Our scoring methodology is explained. Our payment timelines are guaranteed. We do not hide behind opaque portals or undisclosed algorithms. Contractor will always know exactly how they are being measured, exactly what they are being paid, and exactly where they stand.

### 3.5 Compliance Without Bureaucratic Burden

We require rigorous adherence to IICRC standards, carrier guidelines, and applicable law. We do not require unnecessary paperwork, redundant portal entries, or compliance theater. Every documentation requirement in this Agreement exists because it serves a specific purpose: protecting the policyholder, satisfying the carrier, or shielding the contractor from liability. If a requirement stops serving that purpose, we will remove it.

---

## 7. ASSIGNMENT ACCEPTANCE AND RESPONSE TIME STANDARDS

### 7.1 Assignment Dispatch

Reliable Claim dispatches assignments through the Reliable Claim platform via push notification, email, and SMS simultaneously. Each assignment dispatch includes:

- Policyholder name and contact information
- Loss site address
- Type of loss (water, fire, mold, storm, etc.)
- Category and urgency classification (Emergency or Standard)
- Carrier name and claim number
- Adjuster contact information (when available)
- Any carrier-specific instructions or requirements
- Scope limitation notes (if applicable)

Reliable Claim commits to providing complete and accurate dispatch information with every assignment. If Contractor identifies missing or inaccurate information upon acceptance, Contractor may contact the Reliable Claim operations center for clarification without penalty to response time SLAs.

### 7.2 Emergency Assignment Response Standards

| SLA | Target | Measurement |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| Assignment acknowledgment | Within **fifteen (15) minutes** of dispatch | Timestamp of acceptance or declination on platform |
| Policyholder contact (live phone call) | Within **thirty (30) minutes** of acceptance | Logged call timestamp on platform |
| On-site arrival | Within **four (4) hours** of acceptance | GPS check-in or timestamped arrival photo |
| Mitigation work commenced | Within **one (1) hour** of on-site arrival | First documented action (extraction started, equipment placed, board-up begun, etc.) |

**Primary Market Enhancement:** In territories designated as Contractor's primary service area (within a thirty (30) mile radius of Contractor's base of operations), the on-site arrival target for Emergency Assignments is **two (2) hours** from acceptance.

### 7.3 Standard Assignment Response Standards

| SLA | Target | Measurement |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| Assignment acknowledgment | Within **thirty (30) minutes** during Business Hours; within **two (2) hours** outside Business Hours | Timestamp on platform |
| Policyholder contact (phone call) | Within **four (4) hours** during Business Hours; within **twelve (12) hours** if dispatched after hours | Logged call timestamp |
| On-site inspection or service commencement | Within **twenty-four (24) hours** of acceptance | GPS check-in or timestamped arrival photo |

### 7.4 Assignment Declination

Contractor may decline any assignment without penalty, provided the declination is submitted through the platform within the acknowledgment window specified in Sections 7.2 or 7.3. Reliable Claim respects that Contractors have capacity limits, scheduling conflicts, and professional judgment about which jobs they can service effectively. Excessive declination (more than 25% of assignments in any rolling thirty-day period) will trigger a capacity review conversation -- not a penalty, but a discussion to ensure the assignment volume and territory still fit the Contractor's operations.

### 7.5 After-Hours and Weekend Availability

(a) Contractor must maintain a functioning after-hours contact method (answering service, on-call phone, or monitored dispatch system) for Emergency Assignments.

(b) Contractor is not required to be available 24/7/365 for Standard Assignments. However, Contractors who opt into extended availability will receive assignment priority during those hours.

(c) Reliable Claim will not penalize Contractors for declining after-hours Standard Assignments, provided Emergency Assignment availability is maintained.

---

## 8. MITIGATION SERVICE STANDARDS

### 8.1 Water Mitigation

All water mitigation services must be performed in accordance with ANSI/IICRC S500 (Standard and Reference Guide for Professional Water Damage Restoration), current edition. The following operational standards apply:

#### 8.1.1 Initial Response Actions

Upon arrival at a water loss, Contractor must:

(a) Identify and, where safely possible, stop the source of water intrusion.

(b) Assess the category (1, 2, or 3) and class (1, 2, 3, or 4) of the water damage per IICRC S500 definitions.

(c) Take initial moisture readings of all affected materials using calibrated moisture detection equipment. Document baseline readings with location, material type, and value.

(d) Photograph all affected areas before any work begins (minimum twenty (20) pre-mitigation photographs covering all affected rooms, floors, walls, ceilings, and contents).

(e) Communicate the initial assessment and recommended scope to the policyholder in plain language.

(f) Begin extraction and/or emergency stabilization measures within one (1) hour of arrival.

#### 8.1.2 Drying Standards and Timelines

| Water Category | Target Drying Timeline | Protocol |
|---------------|----------------------|----------|
| Category 1, Class 1-2 | Three (3) to four (4) days | Extract, dehumidify, monitor |
| Category 1, Class 3-4 | Four (4) to five (5) days | Extract, remove saturated materials as needed, dehumidify, monitor |
| Category 2, All Classes | Three (3) to five (5) days | Extract, antimicrobial treatment, dehumidify, monitor |
| Category 3, All Classes | Five (5) to seven (7) days | Extract, remove and dispose of contaminated materials, disinfect, dehumidify, verify |

These timelines represent targets under normal conditions. Contractor will not be penalized for exceeding target timelines when documented conditions (building construction, ambient humidity, occupancy constraints, or access limitations) reasonably prevented faster drying, provided the delay is documented and communicated.

#### 8.1.3 Equipment Placement and Monitoring

(a) Contractor must maintain an equipment log documenting: type of equipment, serial number or identifier, placement location, date and time of placement, date and time of removal, and daily runtime confirmation.

(b) Equipment must be checked and moisture readings taken at minimum intervals of every **twenty-four (24) hours** during active drying. Reliable Claim recommends twelve (12) hour intervals for Category 2 and Category 3 losses.

(c) Contractor must create a placement map (sketch or digital) showing the location of all air movers, dehumidifiers, and specialty drying equipment in relation to the affected areas.

(d) Drying is considered complete when moisture content of affected materials reaches the established dry standard for the material type as defined in IICRC S500, or when moisture content matches adjacent unaffected materials of the same type.

#### 8.1.4 Antimicrobial Application

Antimicrobial treatment must be applied in accordance with manufacturer specifications and applicable EPA registration requirements. Contractor must document the product used (including EPA registration number), dilution ratio, application method, and areas treated. Antimicrobial application is required for all Category 2 and Category 3 losses and is recommended for Category 1 losses where drying is expected to exceed forty-eight (48) hours.

### 8.2 Mold Remediation

All mold remediation services must be performed in accordance with ANSI/IICRC S520 (Standard for Professional Mold Remediation), current edition.

(a) Containment must be established before remediation begins. Contractor must document containment setup with photographs and specify the type of containment used (full, limited, or source).

(b) Air filtration devices (AFDs/HEPA air scrubbers) must be operated continuously within the containment area during remediation and for a minimum of twenty-four (24) hours after remediation is complete.

(c) Contractor must coordinate with a qualified third-party industrial hygienist or environmental consultant for post-remediation verification (PRV) testing when required by the carrier or by state regulation. Contractor shall not perform its own clearance testing.

(d) Mold remediation timelines:

| Project Size | Target Timeline | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Small (less than 10 sq ft) | One (1) to two (2) days | Source identification and remediation |
| Medium (10-100 sq ft) | Three (3) to five (5) days | Full containment, remediation, PRV |
| Large (greater than 100 sq ft) | Five (5) to ten (10) days | Engineering controls, multi-phase remediation, PRV |

### 8.3 Emergency Stabilization

Emergency board-up, tarping, and temporary stabilization services must be completed on the same day as the Emergency Assignment acceptance, subject to material availability and safe working conditions.

(a) Board-up materials must be appropriate for the opening size and security requirements. Plywood must be a minimum of 1/2 inch thickness for window and door openings.

(b) Tarping must provide waterproof coverage extending a minimum of four (4) feet beyond the damaged area on all sides where roof geometry permits.

(c) Contractor must photograph all emergency stabilization measures upon completion and provide the policyholder with a written description of the temporary protection installed.

### 8.4 Contents Handling

When contents protection, pack-out, or inventory services are included in the assignment scope:

(a) Contents pack-out must be completed within **twenty-four (24) to forty-eight (48) hours** of authorization.

(b) A detailed inventory list must be created for all items packed, including item description, condition at time of packing, and box or container number. Photographic documentation of high-value items (estimated value over $250) is required.

(c) Packed contents must be stored in a secure, climate-controlled facility. Contractor must provide the storage facility name, address, and contact information to both the policyholder and Reliable Claim.

(d) Contents must be returned to the policyholder within seven (7) days of receiving a return authorization, in the same or better condition as when packed.

---

## 9. RECONNAISSANCE AND INSPECTION SERVICE STANDARDS

### 9.1 Purpose of Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance (recon) assignments are dispatched to gather accurate, objective information about a loss for the benefit of the carrier, adjuster, and policyholder. The recon contractor is the eyes and ears on the ground. The value of a recon is in its thoroughness, objectivity, and speed -- not in advocacy for any party. Contractor performing recon services must approach every inspection with professional neutrality.

### 9.2 Scope of Reconnaissance Services

A standard recon assignment includes the following deliverables unless the specific assignment dispatch indicates otherwise:

(a) **Site Arrival Verification.** GPS-stamped check-in confirming arrival at the loss site within the response time window specified in Section 7.

(b) **Exterior Inspection.** Assessment of all exterior surfaces relevant to the reported loss, including roof (where safely accessible), siding, windows, doors, foundation, grading, and drainage. Minimum fifteen (15) exterior photographs documenting conditions from all four elevations.

(c) **Interior Inspection.** Room-by-room assessment of all areas affected by or adjacent to the reported loss. Minimum five (5) photographs per affected room, capturing overall condition, specific damage, and relevant details (water staining boundaries, char patterns, affected materials).

(d) **Moisture Assessment.** For water losses: moisture readings of all potentially affected materials using calibrated moisture meters. Readings documented by location, material, and value. Moisture mapping diagram showing the extent of moisture migration.

(e) **Cause-of-Loss Observation.** Factual observation of the apparent cause of loss based on visible evidence. Contractor provides observations, not determinations -- cause-of-loss determination remains the adjuster's responsibility.

(f) **Damage Inventory.** Itemized list of damaged building components and contents observed during inspection, with estimated dimensions and quantities where measurable.

(g) **Preliminary Scope Assessment.** Written assessment of the anticipated scope of repairs or mitigation needed, including any immediate safety concerns or emergency measures recommended.

(h) **Environmental Conditions.** Notation of ambient temperature, relative humidity, and weather conditions at the time of inspection.

### 9.3 Reconnaissance Report Deliverables

| Deliverable | Timeline | Format |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Preliminary findings (verbal or written summary) | Within **four (4) hours** of completing the on-site inspection | Phone call to adjuster or written summary via platform |
| Full reconnaissance report with photos | Within **twenty-four (24) hours** of completing the on-site inspection | Uploaded to Reliable Claim platform in prescribed format |
| Moisture map and readings (water losses) | Included with full report | Digital format with location key |
| Preliminary scope/estimate (if requested) | Within **forty-eight (48) hours** of inspection | Xactimate format via platform |

### 9.4 Reconnaissance Quality Standards

(a) **Minimum Photography.** Each recon report must contain a minimum of **forty (40) photographs** for a standard single-family residence. Larger or more complex losses require proportionally more documentation. Every photograph must be timestamped, and Reliable Claim recommends geo-tagged photographs where the platform supports it.

(b) **Completeness.** The recon report must be sufficiently detailed that a desk adjuster who has never visited the property can make an informed coverage and scope decision based solely on the report. If information is unavailable or an area is inaccessible, the report must note the limitation and the reason.

(c) **Objectivity.** Recon reports must present factual observations. Contractor should clearly distinguish between observed facts (e.g., "water staining observed on ceiling drywall measuring approximately 3 feet by 4 feet") and professional opinions (e.g., "staining pattern is consistent with a slow roof leak"). Speculation and advocacy language are not appropriate in recon reports.

(d) **Consistency.** Reliable Claim provides standardized report templates through the platform. Contractor must use these templates to ensure consistency across all recon reports. Carrier-specific template variations will be communicated at the time of assignment.

### 9.5 Re-Inspection and Progress Verification

When dispatched for re-inspection or progress verification:

(a) Contractor must compare current conditions to prior documentation (original recon report, mitigation start photos, etc.) and note all changes, progress, or concerns.

(b) Updated moisture readings must be taken at the same locations documented in the original assessment for direct comparison.

(c) Re-inspection reports must be submitted within **twenty-four (24) hours** of the site visit.

## 10. DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING STANDARDS

### 10.1 General Documentation Principles

Documentation is the backbone of every insurance claim. Incomplete, late, or inaccurate documentation delays claim resolution, erodes carrier confidence, and exposes all parties to unnecessary risk. Reliable Claim holds documentation to a high standard because it protects Contractor as much as it protects the carrier and policyholder.

Every document submitted must be:
- **Accurate** -- reflecting actual conditions, measurements, and work performed
- **Complete** -- including all required fields, attachments, and supporting materials
- **Timely** -- submitted within the deadlines specified in this Agreement
- **Professional** -- written in clear, grammatically correct language suitable for inclusion in a claim file that may be reviewed by adjusters, attorneys, regulators, or courts

### 10.2 Photographic Documentation Standards

| Requirement | Standard |
|------------|---------|
| Pre-work photos (mitigation) | Minimum **twenty (20)** photos before any work begins |
| Progress photos (mitigation) | Minimum **ten (10)** photos per day of active mitigation |
| Completion photos | Minimum **fifteen (15)** photos documenting final conditions |
| Recon photos | Minimum **forty (40)** photos per standard single-family inspection |
| Photo format | JPEG, minimum 2 megapixels, timestamped |
| Photo organization | Labeled by room/area and chronological phase (before, during, after) |
| Close-up details | At least one close-up for each distinct damage area showing material type and extent |
| Wide-angle context | At least one wide-angle photo per affected room showing overall scope |

### 10.3 Moisture Documentation

| Requirement | Standard |
|------------|---------|
| Initial readings | All potentially affected materials at time of first inspection |
| Monitoring frequency | Every **twenty-four (24) hours** minimum during active drying |
| Documentation format | Location, material type, reading value, instrument used, date, time |
| Moisture map | Sketch or digital diagram showing reading locations, updated daily |
| Dry standard reference | Document the target dry standard for each material type |
| Final readings | All previously affected materials at conclusion of drying, compared to dry standard and/or unaffected reference materials |

### 10.4 Equipment Documentation

| Requirement | Standard |
|------------|---------|
| Equipment log | Type, identifier, placement location, start date/time, removal date/time |
| Placement map | Diagram showing equipment locations within the structure |
| Daily verification | Confirmation that all equipment is operational each monitoring visit |
| Runtime tracking | Total hours per piece of equipment, reconciled with invoice |

### 10.5 Daily Job Logs

For all active mitigation jobs, Contractor must maintain a daily job log documenting:
- Date and time of each site visit
- Personnel on-site (name and certification level)
- Work performed during the visit
- Moisture readings taken (reference to moisture log)
- Equipment status (operating, adjusted, removed)
- Observations and any concerns
- Communication with policyholder (topics discussed, next steps communicated)
- Estimated remaining timeline

Daily job logs must be uploaded to the Reliable Claim platform by **8:00 PM local time** on the day of the site visit, or by **8:00 AM** the following Business Day for after-hours visits.

### 10.6 Document Retention

Contractor must retain all original documentation (photographs, moisture readings, equipment logs, estimates, correspondence, and reports) related to each assignment for a minimum of **seven (7) years** from the date of the Completion Certificate, or such longer period as required by applicable law or carrier contract. Upon expiration of the retention period, Contractor must securely dispose of or delete all policyholder personally identifiable information in accordance with applicable data privacy laws.

---

## 11. COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS

### 11.1 Policyholder Communication

Reliable Claim considers communication quality to be the single most important driver of policyholder satisfaction. Contractors are the face of the claim experience for the policyholder. Every interaction must be professional, empathetic, and informative.

| Communication Requirement | Standard | Method |
|--------------------------|---------|--------|
| Initial contact after acceptance | **30 minutes** (emergency) / **4 hours** (standard, during Business Hours) | Live phone call -- not voicemail, text, or email unless policyholder is unreachable after two attempts |
| Status updates during active job | Every **forty-eight (48) hours** minimum | Phone call or text message per policyholder's stated preference; documented on platform |
| Returned calls or messages from policyholder | Within **two (2) hours** during Business Hours | Phone call |
| After-hours policyholder messages | By **9:00 AM** the next Business Day | Phone call |
| Completion notification | Within **one (1) hour** of work completion | Phone call to policyholder, followed by written summary via platform |
| Final walkthrough | Scheduled within **twenty-four (24) hours** of work completion | In-person or video walkthrough with policyholder |

### 11.2 Communication Tone and Content

(a) Contractor must explain all work being performed in plain, non-technical language. Policyholders are experiencing property damage -- often for the first time. Clarity and patience are essential.

(b) Contractor must not make representations about coverage, policy limits, or claim outcomes. Coverage determinations are the exclusive responsibility of the carrier and adjuster. If a policyholder asks about coverage, Contractor should direct them to their adjuster or Reliable Claim's policyholder support line.

(c) Contractor must not disparage the carrier, adjuster, Reliable Claim, or any other party involved in the claim. Professional disagreements about scope or process should be raised through proper channels, not discussed with the policyholder.

(d) Contractor must not solicit additional work from the policyholder outside the scope of the Reliable Claim assignment without prior written approval from Reliable Claim. This includes solicitation of rebuild work, roofing, HVAC, or any other services not included in the current assignment.

### 11.3 Adjuster and Carrier Communication

| Communication Requirement | Standard | Method |
|--------------------------|---------|--------|
| Initial scope/assessment report | Within **twenty-four (24) hours** of first inspection | Uploaded to platform with photos |
| Status updates during active job | Every **forty-eight (48) hours** or at each milestone, whichever is sooner | Platform update; phone call for significant developments |
| Scope change notification | Within **four (4) hours** of discovering additional damage or scope change | Phone call to adjuster, followed by written notification via platform; before additional work begins |
| Supplement submission | Within **seventy-two (72) hours** of scope change identification | Xactimate format via platform with supporting documentation |
| Completion certificate | Within **twenty-four (24) hours** of final work completion | Uploaded to platform with final photos and readings |
| Invoice submission | Within **forty-eight (48) hours** of completion certificate | Clean, accurate, line-item invoice via platform |

### 11.4 Reliable Claim Communication

| Communication Requirement | Standard | Method |
|--------------------------|---------|--------|
| Assignment dispatch | Complete and accurate, with all required information | Platform, email, and SMS simultaneously |
| Response to Contractor inquiries | Within **four (4) Business Hours** | Phone, email, or platform message |
| Supplement review acknowledgment | Within **two (2) Business Days** of submission | Platform notification |
| Supplement decision | Within **five (5) Business Days** of submission | Written decision via platform with explanation |
| Scorecard delivery | By the **10th Business Day** of each month for the prior month's performance | Platform and email |
| Payment processing | Per Section 14 | Direct deposit |

### 11.5 Escalation Protocol

Issues that cannot be resolved through standard communication channels should be escalated as follows:

| Level | Contact | Response Time | Examples |
|-------|---------|--------------|----------|
| Level 1 | Contractor's assigned Reliable Claim coordinator | 4 Business Hours | Scheduling conflicts, documentation questions, platform issues |
| Level 2 | Reliable Claim Operations Manager | 1 Business Day | SLA disputes, scope disagreements, payment questions |
| Level 3 | Reliable Claim Director of Contractor Relations | 2 Business Days | Corrective action appeals, contract interpretation, relationship issues |
| Level 4 | Reliable Claim Executive Team | 5 Business Days | Formal disputes, termination appeals, systemic concerns |

---

## 12. ESTIMATING AND INVOICING STANDARDS

### 12.1 Estimating Requirements

(a) All estimates must be prepared in **Xactimate** using the applicable carrier price list and profile, unless the carrier has specified an alternative estimating platform.

(b) Estimates must be line-item detailed, with each line item corresponding to a specific task, material, or piece of equipment tied to the documented scope of work.

(c) Contractor must use current, locally applicable Xactimate pricing. Manual price overrides require written justification.

(d) Estimate categories must be clearly delineated (e.g., water extraction, demolition, drying equipment, antimicrobial treatment, contents manipulation).

### 12.2 Estimate Submission Timelines

| Estimate Type | Deadline | Notes |
|--------------|----------|-------|
| Preliminary estimate (mitigation) | Within **forty-eight (48) hours** of initial inspection | May be refined as drying progresses |
| Final estimate (mitigation) | Within **twenty-four (24) hours** of Completion Certificate | Reflects actual work performed, equipment runtime, and materials used |
| Recon scope estimate (when requested) | Within **forty-eight (48) hours** of inspection | Based on observed damage; subject to adjuster approval |

### 12.3 Invoicing Standards

(a) Invoices must reconcile to the approved estimate. Variances exceeding two percent (2%) of the approved amount require explanation and supporting documentation.

(b) Invoices must be submitted through the Reliable Claim platform within **forty-eight (48) hours** of the Completion Certificate.

(c) Each invoice must include: Reliable Claim assignment number, carrier claim number, policyholder name, loss site address, detailed line items matching the approved estimate, and total amount due.

(d) **Invoice accuracy target: less than two percent (2%) revision rate.** Invoices requiring revision due to errors, omissions, or unsupported charges will be returned to Contractor with specific correction notes. Chronic invoicing errors (revision rate exceeding 5% over any rolling ninety-day period) will trigger additional review protocols.

(e) Contractor shall not balance-bill the policyholder for any amount beyond the policyholder's applicable deductible without prior written authorization from the carrier and Reliable Claim. Unauthorized balance billing is a material breach of this Agreement.

---

## 13. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT

### 13.1 Reliable Claim Scorecard

Reliable Claim measures Contractor performance through a monthly Scorecard reflecting the following categories and weights:

| Category | Weight | Key Metrics |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Response Time** | 25% | Assignment acceptance speed, policyholder contact speed, on-site arrival time |
| **Documentation Quality** | 25% | Photo count and quality, moisture log completeness, report accuracy, estimate precision |
| **Communication** | 20% | Policyholder update frequency, adjuster communication timeliness, returned call speed |
| **Workmanship** | 20% | Inspection pass rate, callback rate, IICRC compliance, drying effectiveness |
| **Professionalism** | 10% | Policyholder survey scores, adjuster feedback, conduct compliance |

### 13.2 Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Overall Scorecard | 85% or above | Weighted composite of all categories |
| Customer satisfaction (CSAT) | 95% or above | Post-job policyholder survey (5-point scale, 4+ = satisfied) |
| Would-recommend rate | 97% or above | Post-job survey question |
| First-time inspection pass rate | 95% or above | Re-inspection results (random and triggered) |
| Callback/redo rate | Less than 3% | Complaints or rework requests within 30 days of completion |
| Invoice accuracy | Less than 2% revision rate | Invoices returned for correction as percentage of total |
| IICRC compliance | 100% | Adherence to applicable IICRC standard on every job |

### 13.3 Quality Review Methods

Reliable Claim employs the following quality review methods:

(a) **Desk Review.** Every job file is reviewed for documentation completeness and SLA compliance within five (5) Business Days of Completion Certificate submission. Desk reviews evaluate photo documentation, moisture logs, equipment logs, estimate accuracy, and timeline compliance.

(b) **Random Re-Inspection.** Reliable Claim or its designated quality assurance representative will conduct unannounced re-inspections on a random sample of completed jobs. The target re-inspection rate is ten percent (10%) of all completed jobs annually.

(c) **Triggered Re-Inspection.** A re-inspection will be initiated in response to any policyholder complaint, adjuster concern, or desk review finding that suggests workmanship or documentation deficiency.

(d) **Policyholder Survey.** An automated satisfaction survey is sent to the policyholder within forty-eight (48) hours of Completion Certificate. The survey covers communication quality, professionalism, workmanship, timeliness, and overall satisfaction. Contractor's survey completion rate target is eighty percent (80%) or above (i.e., 80% of policyholders respond).

(e) **Adjuster Feedback.** Adjusters are invited to provide feedback on Contractor performance through the Reliable Claim platform. Adjuster feedback is weighted in the Professionalism category of the Scorecard.

### 13.4 Scorecard Transparency

(a) Scorecards are delivered to Contractor by the 10th Business Day of each month, covering the prior month's performance.

(b) Each Scorecard includes: individual metric scores, composite score, trend data (current month vs. prior three months), specific SLA misses with job-level detail, and peer benchmarking (anonymized percentile ranking within the network).

(c) Contractor may dispute any Scorecard metric within ten (10) Business Days of delivery by submitting a written explanation with supporting documentation through the platform. Reliable Claim will review and respond within five (5) Business Days.

## 14. PAYMENT TERMS AND FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS

### 14.1 Reliable Claim's Payment Commitment

Reliable Claim is acutely aware that slow payment is the single greatest source of contractor frustration in the insurance restoration industry. We make the following commitments:

| Payment SLA | Target | Industry Comparison |
|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Payment upon approved invoice | **Net Fifteen (15) calendar days** from invoice approval | Industry standard: 30-90 days |
| Invoice review and approval | Within **seven (7) Business Days** of submission | Industry standard: 15-30 days |
| Total cycle: submission to payment | **Twenty-two (22) calendar days maximum** (7 Business Days review + 15 calendar days payment) | Industry standard: 45-120 days |

### 14.2 Payment Method

All payments are made via direct deposit (ACH) to Contractor's designated bank account. Contractor must provide and maintain current banking information on the Reliable Claim platform. Changes to banking information require five (5) Business Days to process and may require verbal verification for fraud prevention.

### 14.3 Fee Structure

Reliable Claim publishes its complete fee schedule. There are no hidden fees, no undisclosed deductions, and no retroactive fee adjustments.

| Fee | Description | Basis |
|-----|-------------|-------|
| Program fee | Published percentage of approved invoice amount | Deducted at time of payment |
| Onboarding fee | None | Reliable Claim does not charge for onboarding, applications, or credentialing |
| Technology fee | None | Platform access is included in the program fee |
| Renewal fee | None | Annual recredentialing is included in the program fee |

The program fee percentage is disclosed to Contractor during onboarding and documented in Exhibit B (Fee Schedule) to this Agreement. Any change to the program fee requires sixty (60) days' written notice and applies only to assignments dispatched after the effective date of the change.

### 14.4 Supplement Payment

Approved supplements are paid on the same Net Fifteen (15) day terms as original invoices. The supplement payment cycle begins upon approval of the supplemental invoice -- not upon approval of the supplement scope. This means Contractor is not waiting for two sequential approval processes before the payment clock starts.

### 14.5 Disputed Invoices

If Reliable Claim identifies an issue with an invoice that prevents full approval:

(a) Reliable Claim will notify Contractor in writing within seven (7) Business Days of invoice submission, specifying the nature of the dispute and the amount in question.

(b) The undisputed portion of the invoice will be approved and paid on the standard Net Fifteen (15) day schedule. Only the disputed portion is withheld pending resolution.

(c) Contractor has ten (10) Business Days to respond to the dispute with supporting documentation.

(d) Reliable Claim will render a final decision within five (5) Business Days of receiving Contractor's response.

(e) If the dispute is resolved in Contractor's favor, the withheld amount is paid within five (5) Business Days of resolution, plus a five percent (5%) late payment premium if the total payment cycle exceeded thirty (30) calendar days from original invoice submission through no fault of Contractor.

### 14.6 Late Payment

If Reliable Claim fails to make payment within the Net Fifteen (15) day window for an approved, undisputed invoice, Contractor is entitled to a late payment premium of one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the invoice amount per month (or portion thereof) of delay, calculated from the 16th calendar day after invoice approval.

---

## 15. WARRANTY AND CALLBACK OBLIGATIONS

### 15.1 Workmanship Warranty

Contractor warrants that all mitigation work performed under this Agreement will be free from defects in workmanship for a period of **five (5) years** from the date of the Completion Certificate. This warranty covers the quality of labor and the proper application of materials and techniques. It does not cover:

- Pre-existing conditions not caused by the warranted work
- Damage caused by subsequent events (new water intrusion, fire, storm, etc.)
- Normal wear and deterioration
- Conditions caused by the policyholder's failure to maintain the property or follow post-mitigation care instructions provided by Contractor

### 15.2 Warranty Scope for Reconnaissance Services

Reconnaissance services carry a **one (1) year** accuracy warranty. Contractor warrants that the observations, measurements, and findings in the recon report accurately represented the conditions present at the time of inspection, as observable through the inspection methods employed. This warranty does not extend to conditions that were concealed, inaccessible, or not visible at the time of inspection, provided the report noted the limitation.

### 15.3 Callback Response

If a warranty claim or callback is received:

(a) Contractor must respond to the callback notification within **twenty-four (24) hours**.

(b) Contractor must schedule a return inspection within **forty-eight (48) hours** of the callback notification, unless a later date is mutually agreed with the policyholder.

(c) Warranted repairs must be completed within **five (5) Business Days** of the return inspection, unless parts, materials, or scheduling constraints require additional time (documented and communicated).

(d) Callback work performed under warranty is at Contractor's sole expense. Reliable Claim does not compensate Contractor for warranty callbacks.

(e) If Contractor fails to respond to or resolve a warranty callback within the timeframes specified, Reliable Claim reserves the right to dispatch another contractor to perform the work and charge the cost to the original Contractor.

### 15.4 Warranty Transfer

The workmanship warranty is transferable and runs with the property. If the policyholder sells the property during the warranty period, the new owner is entitled to the remaining warranty coverage.

---

## 16. POLICYHOLDER RIGHTS AND CONDUCT STANDARDS

### 16.1 Policyholder Treatment Standards

Contractor and all of Contractor's employees, agents, and subcontractors must:

(a) Treat every policyholder and occupant with courtesy, respect, and empathy. Property damage is stressful. The policyholder did not choose to have a claim.

(h) Never consume alcohol, use tobacco products, or use controlled substances on the policyholder's property.

(i) Secure the property when leaving. Ensure all doors and windows are locked or secured, and alarm systems are reactivated if they were deactivated during the work.

### 16.2 Policyholder Consent

(a) Contractor must obtain verbal or written authorization from the policyholder (or their authorized representative) before entering the property for the first time.

(b) Contractor must explain the scope of work to the policyholder in plain language before beginning any mitigation or invasive inspection. The policyholder has the right to ask questions and receive clear answers.

(c) If the recommended scope involves demolition, removal of building materials, or other destructive measures, Contractor must specifically describe what will be removed or altered and obtain the policyholder's acknowledgment before proceeding.

### 16.3 Policyholder Complaints

All policyholder complaints must be reported to Reliable Claim within **four (4) hours** of receipt, regardless of whether Contractor believes the complaint is justified. Reliable Claim will work with Contractor and the policyholder to resolve the complaint, but suppressing, ignoring, or failing to report a complaint is grounds for corrective action.

---

## 17. SAFETY AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

### 17.1 Occupational Safety

(a) Contractor must comply with all applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards and state occupational safety regulations.

(b) All field personnel must have completed, at minimum, the OSHA 10-hour General Industry or Construction safety course.

(b) **Asbestos.** Contractor must not disturb known or suspected asbestos-containing materials (ACM). If ACM is encountered during the course of work, Contractor must stop work in the affected area, notify the policyholder and Reliable Claim, and recommend qualified asbestos abatement prior to continuing.

(c) **Refrigerants.** Contractor must not vent refrigerants to the atmosphere. Refrigerant recovery must be performed by EPA Section 608-certified technicians.

(d) **Wastewater Discharge.** Extracted water must be disposed of in compliance with local sewer discharge ordinances. Category 3 water and water containing regulated contaminants must not be discharged into storm drains.

(e) **Waste Disposal.** Demolished building materials, contaminated contents, and hazardous waste must be disposed of in compliance with federal, state, and local regulations. Contractor must retain disposal manifests for hazardous waste.

### 17.3 Licensing and Permitting

(a) Contractor must hold all licenses, permits, and registrations required by the jurisdiction in which the work is performed. This includes general contractor licenses, specialty licenses (mold remediation, asbestos, lead), and business licenses.

(b) Contractor is responsible for obtaining all job-specific permits required by local authorities having jurisdiction (AHJ). Permit costs are reimbursable if included in the approved estimate.

(c) Contractor must not perform work that exceeds the scope of its licensure. If an assignment requires work outside Contractor's license scope, Contractor must notify Reliable Claim immediately so that the work can be assigned to an appropriately licensed contractor.

---

## 18. TECHNOLOGY AND PLATFORM REQUIREMENTS

### 18.1 Reliable Claim Platform

Contractor must use the Reliable Claim platform as the primary system for:

- Receiving and accepting/declining assignments
- Uploading all documentation (photos, moisture logs, equipment logs, reports)
- Submitting estimates and invoices
- Communicating assignment status updates
- Receiving Scorecards and performance feedback
- Managing credentials and insurance certificates

### 18.3 Platform Training

Reliable Claim provides complimentary platform training during onboarding and as needed thereafter. Contractor is expected to maintain proficiency with the platform. Reliable Claim publishes help guides, video tutorials, and hosts periodic webinars on platform features and updates.

### 18.4 System Outages

In the event of a Reliable Claim platform outage:

(a) Reliable Claim will notify Contractors via SMS and email within thirty (30) minutes of becoming aware of a system-wide outage.

(b) During outages, assignments may be dispatched via phone or email. Response time SLAs remain in effect, measured from the time of verbal or email dispatch.

(c) Documentation that cannot be uploaded during an outage must be uploaded within twenty-four (24) hours of system restoration.

(d) Contractor will not be penalized for platform-related documentation delays during confirmed outages.

---

## 19. WORKLOAD MANAGEMENT AND CAPACITY PLANNING

### 19.1 Capacity Declaration

During onboarding and at each annual recredentialing, Contractor will declare:

(a) **Maximum concurrent jobs.** The number of active mitigation and/or recon assignments Contractor can manage simultaneously while maintaining SLA compliance.

(b) **Preferred weekly volume.** The number of new assignments per week that Contractor considers optimal.

(c) **Crew capacity.** The number of field crews or inspectors available, including any seasonal variations.

(d) **Service territory.** The geographic area(s) Contractor is prepared to service, with primary and secondary market designations.

### 19.2 Reliable Claim's Workload Commitment

Reliable Claim will not dispatch assignments to a Contractor that would knowingly exceed the Contractor's declared capacity. We would rather dispatch to another qualified Contractor than overburden an existing one. The goal is sustained quality, not surge-and-burnout.

(a) Assignment dispatch algorithms consider Contractor's current active job count against declared maximum capacity.

(b) If Contractor is approaching capacity, the platform will reduce dispatch frequency. Contractor can also manually set status to "At Capacity" in the platform to pause new assignments temporarily.

(c) Contractor may update capacity declarations at any time through the platform. Changes take effect within one (1) Business Day.

### 19.3 Volume Commitments

Reliable Claim does not guarantee a minimum assignment volume. However:

(a) Reliable Claim will make commercially reasonable efforts to distribute assignments equitably among qualified Contractors within each service territory, weighted by performance tier (see Section 20) and declared capacity.

(b) If Contractor's assignment volume falls below Contractor's declared preferred weekly volume for three (3) or more consecutive weeks (excluding periods when Contractor has voluntarily reduced capacity or during seasonal low-claim periods), Contractor may request a territory and volume review meeting with their Reliable Claim coordinator.

(c) Reliable Claim will be transparent about the factors affecting assignment volume in any given territory, including network density, claim volume trends, and carrier program activity.

---

## 20. PERFORMANCE TIERS AND ASSIGNMENT PRIORITY

### 20.1 Tier Structure

Reliable Claim uses a three-tier performance system based on Scorecard results:

| Tier | Scorecard Range | Assignment Priority | Benefits |
|------|----------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Preferred** | 90% and above | First priority in service territory | First access to new assignments, priority for high-value and specialty jobs, eligibility for carrier-specific programs, featured status in Reliable Claim marketing materials, invitation to Preferred Contractor advisory council |
| **Qualified** | 75% - 89% | Standard priority | Standard assignment rotation, full access to all standard job types |
| **Developing** | 60% - 74% | Reduced priority | Reduced assignment volume, enhanced quality review on all jobs, assigned mentor from Preferred tier (if available), required corrective action plan |

### 20.2 Tier Determination

(a) Tier placement is determined by the rolling three-month average Scorecard score.

(b) New Contractors enter the network at the **Qualified** tier during their probationary period, regardless of individual job performance.

(c) Tier changes (up or down) take effect on the first day of the month following the month in which the rolling three-month average crosses a tier threshold.

(d) Contractor is notified of any tier change at least five (5) Business Days before the effective date.

### 20.3 Tier Advancement

There is no artificial cap on the number of Preferred tier Contractors. Every Contractor who earns a 90%+ Scorecard receives Preferred status. We want every Contractor in our network to be Preferred.

### 20.4 Below-Threshold Performance

A Scorecard average below 60% over any rolling three-month period will initiate the Corrective Action process described in Section 21. Reliable Claim's goal is to help every Contractor succeed, but sustained performance below the Developing tier is not sustainable for the network, the carriers, or the policyholders we serve.

---

## 21. CORRECTIVE ACTION AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION

### 21.1 Corrective Action Process

Reliable Claim follows a progressive corrective action process designed to identify problems early and provide Contractors with a genuine opportunity to improve:

**Step 1: Performance Advisory (Informal)**
- Triggered by: First occurrence of a material SLA miss, or Scorecard dipping below 75%
- Action: Phone call or video meeting with Reliable Claim coordinator to review the issue, identify root cause, and discuss solutions
- Documentation: Written summary provided to Contractor
- Follow-up: Thirty (30) day check-in

**Step 2: Performance Improvement Plan (Formal)**
- Triggered by: Recurring SLA misses after advisory, or Scorecard below 60%
- Action: Written Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) with specific, measurable objectives and a sixty (60) day improvement period
- Support: Reliable Claim assigns a dedicated quality coach and provides additional training resources
- Review: Performance reviewed at thirty (30) and sixty (60) day marks

**Step 3: Probationary Status**
- Triggered by: Failure to meet PIP objectives within sixty (60) days
- Action: Reduced assignment volume, enhanced review on all jobs, ninety (90) day probationary period
- Review: If performance improves to Developing tier or above, probation is lifted and standard assignment volume resumes. If performance does not improve, proceed to Step 4.

**Step 4: Network Separation**
- Triggered by: Failure to improve during probation, or any single act of gross misconduct, fraud, or willful negligence
- Action: Removal from the Reliable Claim contractor network
- Notice: Thirty (30) days' written notice except in cases of fraud, safety violations endangering persons, or criminal conduct, which may result in immediate separation
- Transition: Active jobs will be completed by Contractor unless Reliable Claim determines that reassignment is necessary to protect the policyholder or carrier

### 21.2 Immediate Removal Events

The following constitute grounds for immediate removal from the network without progressive corrective action:

(a) Fraud, misrepresentation, or intentional falsification of documentation, credentials, or invoices
(b) Theft or misappropriation of policyholder property or insurance proceeds
(c) Criminal conduct on or related to an assignment
(d) Physical violence, threats of violence, or harassment directed at a policyholder, carrier representative, or Reliable Claim personnel
(e) Working under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances on a policyholder's property
(f) Unauthorized balance billing of policyholders
(g) Willful violation of safety regulations resulting in injury or imminent danger
(h) Material misrepresentation of insurance coverage (lapsed policies presented as current)

### 21.3 Dispute Resolution

Reliable Claim is committed to resolving disputes fairly and efficiently. The following process applies to disputes arising under this Agreement:

**Step 1: Direct Resolution.** The parties will attempt to resolve the dispute through direct communication between Contractor and the appropriate Reliable Claim manager. Most disputes can and should be resolved at this level.

**Step 2: Mediation.** If direct resolution fails within thirty (30) days, either party may request mediation. Mediation will be conducted by a mutually agreed-upon mediator in the county where Contractor's principal place of business is located. Mediation costs are shared equally.

**Step 3: Binding Arbitration.** If mediation fails within sixty (60) days, either party may initiate binding arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Arbitration will be conducted in the county where Contractor's principal place of business is located. The arbitrator's decision is final and binding.

**Carve-Outs.** The following matters are not subject to arbitration and may be pursued in any court of competent jurisdiction: (a) claims for injunctive relief to prevent irreparable harm, (b) collection actions for undisputed amounts owed, and (c) claims of fraud.

## 22. SUPPLEMENTAL SCOPE PROCESS

### 22.1 When Supplements Arise

Supplements are a normal part of insurance restoration work. Hidden damage is discovered behind walls. Water migration extends beyond initial assessments. Categories escalate. Reliable Claim does not penalize Contractors for identifying legitimate additional scope. In fact, accurate supplementing protects the carrier from underpayment disputes and protects the policyholder from incomplete repairs.

### 22.2 Supplement Submission Requirements

When Contractor identifies damage or required work beyond the originally approved scope:

(a) **Immediate Notification.** Contractor must notify the adjuster and Reliable Claim within **four (4) hours** of discovering the additional scope. This notification must occur **before** any additional work begins, unless the additional work is emergency mitigation necessary to prevent further damage to the property.

(b) **Documentation.** The supplement submission must include:
- Photographs of the newly discovered damage or conditions
- Moisture readings (if applicable) demonstrating the expanded affected area
- Written explanation of why the additional scope is necessary
- Revised Xactimate estimate showing the supplemental line items clearly distinguished from the original scope

(c) **Timeline.** The complete supplement package must be submitted through the Reliable Claim platform within **seventy-two (72) hours** of the scope change discovery.

### 22.3 Supplement Review and Decision

| Step | Responsible Party | Timeline |
|------|-------------------|----------|
| Supplement acknowledgment | Reliable Claim | Within **two (2) Business Days** of submission |
| Review and adjuster coordination | Reliable Claim + Carrier | Within **five (5) Business Days** of submission |
| Decision communicated to Contractor | Reliable Claim | Within **five (5) Business Days** of submission |
| If additional information requested | Contractor | Within **three (3) Business Days** of request |
| Final decision after additional information | Reliable Claim | Within **three (3) Business Days** of receipt |

### 22.4 Supplement Approval Categories

(a) **Approved as Submitted.** The supplement is approved in full. Contractor may proceed with the additional work immediately.

(b) **Approved with Modifications.** The supplement is approved with specific line-item adjustments. Reliable Claim will provide written explanation for each modification. Contractor may accept the modified supplement or escalate to the dispute resolution process.

(c) **Denied.** The supplement is denied with a written explanation. Contractor may resubmit with additional documentation or escalate to the dispute resolution process. Contractor must not perform denied work at Reliable Claim's expense.

### 22.5 Emergency Supplements

When additional work is emergency mitigation necessary to prevent imminent further damage (e.g., discovering an active pipe leak behind a wall during demolition), Contractor may proceed with the emergency work before supplement approval, provided:

(a) Contractor notifies Reliable Claim verbally within one (1) hour of commencing the emergency work.

(b) Contractor documents the emergency conditions with photographs and a written explanation.

(c) The formal supplement is submitted within twenty-four (24) hours.

## 23. CATASTROPHE AND SURGE EVENT PROTOCOLS

### 23.1 CAT Event Declaration

Reliable Claim may declare a Catastrophe (CAT) Event when a natural or man-made event causes claim volume in a geographic area to exceed 200% of normal weekly assignment volume. Upon CAT declaration, modified SLAs take effect to reflect the reality of operating in disaster conditions.

### 23.2 Modified SLAs During CAT Events

| SLA | Standard Target | CAT Event Modified Target |
|-----|----------------|--------------------------|
| Emergency assignment acceptance | 15 minutes | 30 minutes |
| Policyholder contact | 30 minutes | 2 hours |
| On-site arrival (emergency) | 4 hours | 12 hours |
| On-site arrival (standard) | 24 hours | 48 hours |
| Documentation upload | Same day | Within 48 hours |
| Estimate submission | 48 hours | 5 Business Days |

### 23.3 CAT Deployment

(a) Contractors in the affected area will receive increased assignment volume up to their declared maximum capacity.

(b) Contractors outside the affected area may volunteer for CAT deployment. Reliable Claim will coordinate travel, lodging logistics, and temporary service territory assignments for deployed Contractors.

(c) CAT deployment is voluntary. No Contractor is required to deploy outside their declared service territory.

(d) Deployed Contractors must carry all required certifications and insurance coverages in the deployment jurisdiction.

### 23.4 Post-CAT Review

Within thirty (30) days of a CAT Event conclusion, Reliable Claim will conduct a post-event review with participating Contractors to assess what worked, identify areas for improvement, and update CAT protocols as needed.

## 27. AMENDMENTS AND MODIFICATIONS

### 27.1 Process for Amendments

This Agreement may be amended only by written instrument signed by authorized representatives of both parties. Reliable Claim may propose amendments to the general SLA standards (as distinguished from the individually negotiated terms in the Exhibits) by providing sixty (60) days' written notice. Contractor's continued acceptance of assignments after the effective date of the amendment constitutes acceptance of the amended terms. If Contractor objects to a proposed amendment, Contractor may terminate this Agreement under Section 26.2 without penalty.

### 27.2 Carrier-Specific Addenda

Individual carriers may impose requirements that supplement or modify certain SLAs in this Agreement. Such carrier-specific requirements will be documented in a Carrier Addendum provided to Contractor before the first assignment under that carrier's program.

### 27.3 No Oral Modifications
