## 1. Primary TPA/Restoration Contractor SLA Documents

### Citizens Florida Managed Repair Program

These are real, unredacted TPA contracts -- the most valuable primary sources available for understanding how a major carrier structures contractor SLA terms, payment structures, warranty requirements, and performance metrics.

It contains specific SLA terms, payment structures, warranty requirements, performance metrics, and termination conditions. This is the gold standard for understanding real TPA contract language.

## 9. Broader TPA Industry SLA Benchmarks

Compiled from web research across health, workers' compensation, and property/casualty TPA sectors. These provide context for how SLAs are structured beyond the restoration niche.

### Claims Processing Turnaround Times

| Metric | Industry Benchmark |
|---|---|
| Urgent claims (ERISA) | 72 hours |
| Pre-service claims (ERISA) | 15 days (+15-day extension) |
| Post-service claims (ERISA) | 30 days (+15-day extension) |
| Electronic clean claims | 7-14 days (up to 30 days) |
| Paper claims | 30-45 days |
| Medicare clean claims | 30 days |
| API-driven / automated claims | Same-day to next-day |
| Auto-adjudicated medical bills (WC) | 3.5 days vs 12 days manual |

### Accuracy Rates

| Metric | Benchmark |
|---|---|
| Clean claims rate (minimum standard) | 95% |
| Clean claims rate (HFMA best practice) | 98% |
| Typical real-world clean claims rate | 75-85% |
| Top TPA claims accuracy | 99%+ (Brighton: 99%, Keenan: 99.96%) |
| Adjuster quality score (good) | 95%+ |
| Auto-adjudication rate (industry leaders) | 60%+ |

### Response Times / Contact Standards

| Metric | Benchmark |
|---|---|
| 3-Point Contact (WC) | Within 24 hours |
| Claim setup in system | 1 business day of receipt |
| Initial report of injury review | 1 business day |
| Critical issues (general SLA) | 15-30 minute response |
| High-priority issues | 2-4 hour response |
| Low-priority issues | 24-48 hour acknowledgment |

### Workers' Compensation KPIs

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| Time to First Contact | Target: 24 hours to injured worker, employer, and medical provider |
| Diary Compliance | Required check-ins (e.g., every 14 days for TTD) |
| Initial Reserve Accuracy | Correct reserve amount at claim inception |
| Payment Accuracy Rate | Benefit payments calculated correctly first time |
| Medical Bill Processing Speed | Within 30 days (state-dependent) |
| Subrogation Recovery Rate | Total dollars recovered / total paid |
| Return-to-Work Rate | Speed and percentage of injured workers returning |
| Leakage Rate | Losses due to inefficiencies or overpayments |

### SLA Penalty & Remedy Framework

Standard non-compliance remedies found across TPA agreements:

- **Financial penalties / service credits** -- Triggered when service levels fall below thresholds
- **Performance improvement plans** -- Required for sustained underperformance
- **Cure periods** -- Typically 30 days to remedy non-compliance
- **Tiered escalation** -- Repeated violations trigger progressively stricter consequences
- **Contract renegotiation** -- For persistent failures
- **Termination rights** -- For significant or repeated breaches
- **Service credit claims** -- Must typically be submitted within 60 days of the impacted month

## 10. NAIC & Regulatory Frameworks

### NAIC Model Guidelines (GDL-1090)

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners publishes the regulatory framework for TPAs:

- **First adopted:** 1977 (as Model Law 90-1)
- **Most recently amended:** 2001; revised as Guideline GDL-1090
- **Two versions:** Version 1 includes workers' compensation and stop-loss; Version 2 omits workers' compensation
- **Key requirements:** TPA registration/licensing, bond requirements ($100K-$1M), contracting standards, reporting obligations
- **46 states** require licensing or regulatory filings for TPAs
- **Booklet delivery mandate:** "Any policies, certificates, booklets, termination notices or other written communications delivered by the payor to the TPA for delivery to insured parties or covered individuals shall be delivered by the TPA promptly after receipt of instructions from the payor"

### NAIC Independent Adjuster Guidelines (GL-1224)

For TPAs using independent adjusters as contractors:

- Defines independent adjuster IRS tax treatment
- Specifies licensing requirements across property, casualty, and workers' compensation lines
- Outlines duties and restrictions
- Licensing requirements vary by state and line of authority

### Accreditation Standards

| Body | Focus |
|---|---|
| **URAC** (Utilization Review Accreditation Commission) | Claims processing, data security, customer service benchmarks |
